Alright, let's tackle this:

1) The video is designed to be political. In no way does it purport itself to be scientific, other than the fact the physicians who make claims about vaccinations, as they all say, went to undergrad (probably in bio), medical school, residency, and have all been practicing doctors. They, and no one else save pharmacology, immunology and epidemiology researchers, are the only experts on the true effects of vaccinations at both the individual patient level and the effects of vaccinations on society itself. 
2) The posts you have given me are all sourced from a Sue Broz Thorpe, who collected many different links that fall into two categories: 
   A) News articles or law proceedings that in no way actually cover vaccinations, but the problems within the pharma industry. Problems no one really denies. Examples include this: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1440632/ (an article which never discusses vaccinations) and this: http://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-independent-are-vaccine-defenders/ (which talks about the problem with pharma money, yet never discusses the actual science that exists). However, these articles in no way discuss the scientific value or problems that are linked to systemic vaccination. There are definitely issues of transparency in the pharma and medical world (particularly when it comes to public communication), but this does not mean we should abandon the medical benefits of modern medicine, of which vaccines are included. If we do, we can look back in time and see what wonderful things await us: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1200696/ (Smallpox), http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2991634/ (Poliomyelitis)
I should also mention that the creators of the smallpox and polio vaccines, Edward Jenner and Jonas Salk respectively, did not make bank off of these creations (mainly because research scientists in general never make tons of money (comparatively)).
   B) The other types of posts are comprised of scientific articles that actually are comprised of good science, and yet are misinterpreted by people like Sue (one of the perils of confirmation bias when reading primary literature). Examples include this: and this:
